## ⚙️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get EduFlow up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn
*   Git

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Begin by cloning the EduFlow repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TechFox6905/edu-flow.git
    cd edu-flow
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    Install all required project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Or using Yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on the `.env.example` (if available, otherwise create one manually). You'll need to configure variables for your database, authentication, and media services.

    ```ini
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?schema=public"

    # Clerk Authentication
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."

    # Cloudinary Media Management
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
    ```

    *Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.*

4.  **Database Setup**

    Initialize your database schema and run any necessary migrations using Prisma:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

    This command will create the database schema defined in your `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

5.  **Run the Development Server**

    Start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # Or yarn dev
    ```

    The application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.


## 🚀 Usage Examples

Once installed, EduFlow provides a user-friendly interface. Here's a basic example of how to interact with the platform.

### Dashboard Overview

Upon successful login, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard. This typically includes:

*   Upcoming schedule/events.
*   Quick links to courses or administrative sections.
*   Summary statistics (e.g., enrolled students, pending tasks).

```typescript
// Example of a basic component structure in src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { fetchUpcomingEvents } from "@/lib/data"; // Placeholder for data fetching utility

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const user = await currentUser();
  const upcomingEvents = await fetchUpcomingEvents(user?.id);

  if (!user) {
    return <div>Please log in to view your dashboard.</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome, {user.firstName}!</h1>
      <p>Here's a quick overview of your activities.</p>

      <section className="mt-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Your Upcoming Events</h2>
        {upcomingEvents.length > 0 ? (
          <ul>
            {upcomingEvents.map((event) => (
              <li key={event.id} className="mb-2">
                <span className="font-medium">{event.title}</span> -{" "}
                {new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString()}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        ) : (
          <p>No upcoming events.</p>
        )}
      </section>

      {/* [placeholder] Additional dashboard components like charts or course listings */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
